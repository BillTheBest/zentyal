Howto create the install CD

1) Edit configuration file

You must edit the file 'build_cd.conf.local' to reflect your environment.
At least you will need to specify the SVN_ROOT, MAINTAINER_ADRESS and
YOURKEYID variables. The UBUNTU_KEYRING_TAR and UBUNTU_KEYRING_DIR must be
changed to reflect the version number of the package.  The VERSION and the
VERSION_NUMBER keys must reflect the version name and number of the Ubuntu
version remastered for create the CD.
Instead of editing 'build_cd.conf' directly you should put your local data
in the 'build_cd.conf.local' file.

2) Put extra ubuntu packages

You must put all extra .deb archives in the directory pointed by the key
EXTRAS_DIR (in build_cd.conf).  Today the extra packages needed are all
eBox packages and its dependencies not already provided by the base CD.

You can put the packages you want included in the installer in the
'extra-packages.list' file and then use 'generate_extras.sh' script to get them
and their dependencies on a chrooted debootstrap environment.

2.1) Put eBox metapackages

They are built from trunk/extra/ebox-metapackages, you can export it
somewhere, run dpkg-buildpackage and then add them to the EXTRAS_DIR
directory. If they are already uploaded to a repository you can simply
add their names to the 'extra-packages.list' file.

3) Download the ubuntu server iso and setup the build directory

You need to download the ISO file to remaster.  After download it, execute the
setup_build_dir.sh command.

You can also use an already built eBox installer ISO to remaster. Just edit the
build.cd.conf file to change the name of the .iso file.

4) Make sure you have installed the libebox and mkisofs packages in the system
you want to use to create the image.

5) Execute the build CD script

Execute the ./build_cd.sh script, it will ask you about your gpg passphrase a
few times. If the build was sucessful you'll have your ISO written to the file
pointed by the ISO_IMAGE key.
