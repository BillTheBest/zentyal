Description: eBox - Web Server
 eBox Platform is an open source small business server that can act as
 a Gateway, a Unified Threat Manager, an Office Server, an Infrastructure
 Manager, a Unified Communications Server or a combination of them. One
 single, easy-to-use platform to manage all your network services.
 .
 This module adds a pretty simple apache server configuration module to eBox, 
 allowing publication of contents using several virtual hosts and the 
 use of public_html directories within user directories.
