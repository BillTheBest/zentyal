Description: Zentyal - Network Objects
 Zentyal is an open source small business server that can act as
 a Gateway, Unified Threat Manager, Office Server, Infrastructure
 Manager, Unified Communications Server or a combination of them. One
 single, easy-to-use platform to manage all your network services.
 .
 This module adds object support, allowing to manage objects which could be
 used as access control lists (ACL) by other modules. Each object represents
 a certain number of hosts or network, providing an abstraction
 to make easy its use across the Zentyal modules.
