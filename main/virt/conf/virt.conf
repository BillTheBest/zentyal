# You can customize the width and height of the built-in VNC console

# If you want to customize the VNC passwords instead of having
# randomly autogenerated ones you have to create a file
# with the following syntax:
#
# <machine1>:<pass1>
# <machine2>:<pass2>
# ...
#
# Example:
#
# winxp:3uDwdDPzY
# ubuntu-desktop:VKtKzejl7
#
# Save it as /var/lib/zentyal/conf/vnc-passwd
# and set proper secure permissions:
#
# chown ebox:ebox /var/lib/zentyal/conf/vnc-passwd
# chmod 600 /var/lib/zentyal/conf/vnc-passwd
